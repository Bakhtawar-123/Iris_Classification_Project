# Iris_Classification_Project
 Achieving 100% Accuracy in Iris Classification with Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees. Trained models on the Iris dataset using three algorithms, achieving 100% accuracy. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in iris classification.
 
Introduction:
Hey everyone! I recently completed a fascinating project on iris classification, and I wanted to share my findings and experience with you all. In this project, I worked with the famous Iris dataset, which consists of 150 rows and 5 columns. My primary goal was to analyze the data, train models using three different algorithms (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree), and evaluate their accuracy. The most exciting part? All three algorithms achieved a remarkable 100% accuracy! Let's dive into the details.

Dataset Description:
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis. It contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset is widely used for classification tasks due to its simplicity and clear patterns.

Approach:

Data Analysis:
Before diving into the model training, I performed a thorough data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. I explored the distribution of the features, and visualized the relationships between variables using various plots and statistical measures. This step was crucial in understanding the dataset's structure and preparing it for the subsequent modeling phase.

Model Training:
I utilized three different classification algorithms to train the iris classification models:

a) Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification, but it can also be extended to multi-class problems using techniques like one-vs-rest or softmax regression. I applied logistic regression to the Iris dataset, and it yielded remarkable results with a 100% accuracy score.

b) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on the majority vote of its k nearest neighbors. By experimenting with different values of k, I found the optimal parameter that resulted in a 100% accuracy score for the Iris dataset.

c) Decision Tree:
Decision trees are versatile algorithms that recursively split the data based on the most informative features, leading to decision rules. With the Iris dataset, I trained a decision tree classifier, which exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a perfect 100% accuracy score.

Evaluation:
I obtained a 100% accuracy score, indicating that the models were able to accurately classify the iris flowers based on the given features.

Report Generation:
Lastly, I generated a comprehensive report on the Iris classification project. The report includes details about the dataset, data analysis insights. 

Conclusion:
In this project, I successfully tackled the task of iris classification using the Iris dataset. By employing Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree algorithms, I achieved a remarkable 100% accuracy score for all three models. This accomplishment demonstrates the effectiveness of these algorithms in accurately classifying the different iris species based on their measurements. Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions; I'm always eager to learn and improve.

Thank you for your time and happy coding!
